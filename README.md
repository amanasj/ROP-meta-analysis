# ROP-meta-analysis


Complete code used for network meta-analysis as seen in the Ophthalmology journal article: 





A Network Meta-Analysis of Retreatment Rates following Bevacizumab, Ranibizumab, Aflibercept and Laser for Retinopathy of Prematurity

by 

Emer T Chang, Amandeep S Josan, Ravi Purohit, Chetan K Patel, Kanmin Xue






I have included three Rmarkdown files containing the complete code along with analysis commentary used to perform a zone 1, type 1 and type 1 + moderator meta-analyses.



The spreadsheet containing the raw data used in the meta-analaysis is also included (see ROP_data.xlsx).





All Rmarkdown files can be run using Rstudio and no changes to directory paths are needed. Each Rmarkdown file should run correctly as long as no files are removed or rearranged from the top folder.







WARNING :: run each code chunk one at a time. Depending on your machine the whole Rmarkdown file can take a long time to process, especially the Bayesian analysis. In particular the nodesplit analysis takes an extremely long time and is very processor intensive. I have set this chunk off by default but you can turn it on and run it by changing the chunk header to "eval=TRUE"
