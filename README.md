I have included three Rmarkdown files containing the complete code with analysis commentary used to perform a zone 1, type 1 and type 1 + moderator meta-analyses.
The spreadsheet containing the raw data extracted from each journal article contained in the meta-analaysis is also included.



All Rmarkdown files can be run using Rstudio
